# Event Sourcing in Elixir

Experiments with eventsourced implementations in elixir.

### Opinions

- Commands don't always produce the same events for a given state, Side effects can occur.
- State must always be the same for a given application of state and event.
- Events are undeniable event application cannot fail so event handle cant have side effects.
- Entities should never exist in invalid states so sould be sent events grouped by transaction.
- An uninitialised state should always accept a creation event therefore we can skip a creation command and directly add creation event to the store

### Counter using Protocols
An event sourced counter with the follow features.
- In memory ledger of events
- State rebuilding of counter from ledger history
- Multi event handling. (1 command can produce multiple events.)
- Supercharged counting state dispatched using elixir protocols
